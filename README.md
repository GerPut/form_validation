Form Validation

This mini project was built with HTML, CSS an Javascript. The project took half a day to complete. 

The register form checks on the client side that a valid username, email and a password is inserted. The input boxes will turn red with an error message if the user typed/submitted something that is not acceptable. The submit button has an eventlistener('click') that starts the function of the whole program with conditionals to make sure all input fields are correct/acceptable.

The username input gets checked by a function consisting of a piece of regex so that no numbers are present in the username. The email input also gets checked by a function consisting of a line of regex that checks for a valid email. I googled my issue of getting the correct regex to check for a valid username and email. The password input boxes must match other othrwise an error will show.

My main focus with this project was to work with Javascript and CSS. Form validation is a common occurance and I wanted to get more experience with working with forms.
